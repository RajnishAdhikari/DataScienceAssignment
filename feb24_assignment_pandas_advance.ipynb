    "# Q1. List any five functions of the pandas library with execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are five commonly used functions in the Pandas library along with their execution examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `read_csv()`: This function is used to read data from a CSV file and create a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Read data from a CSV file\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the DataFrame\n",
    "print(df)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `head()`: This function returns the first few rows of a DataFrame. By default, it returns the first five rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Read data from a CSV file\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the first 3 rows\n",
    "print(df.head(3))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `info()`: This function provides a summary of the DataFrame, including the data types, number of non-null values, and memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Read data from a CSV file\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the summary information\n",
    "df.info()\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `describe()`: This function generates descriptive statistics of the DataFrame, including count, mean, standard deviation, \n",
    "minimum, maximum, and quartile values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Read data from a CSV file\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate descriptive statistics\n",
    "description = df.describe()\n",
    "print(description)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `groupby()`: This function is used to group data based on one or more columns and perform operations on those groups. \n",
    "It's commonly used for data aggregation and summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Read data from a CSV file\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Group the DataFrame by the 'category' column and calculate the average of 'price' for each group\n",
    "grouped = df.groupby('category')['price'].mean()\n",
    "print(grouped)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions demonstrate some of the fundamental operations in Pandas, such as reading data, exploring the structure \n",
    "of the DataFrame, generating summary statistics, and performing group-based operations."
