    "# Q1. Explain GET and POST methods.\n",
    "GET and POST are two commonly used methods in HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for sending requests from a client (such as a web browser) to a server. \n",
    "These methods define the type of action to be performed on the specified resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. GET Method:\n",
    "   - The GET method is used to retrieve or request data from a specified resource.\n",
    "   - It is a safe and idempotent method, meaning it should not have any side effects on the server and can be called multiple times without changing the \n",
    "   server state.\n",
    "   - When a client sends a GET request, the parameters are sent in the URL's query string.\n",
    "   - The GET method is the default method used by web browsers when you visit a web page.\n",
    "   - It is suitable for retrieving data, reading information, or performing search operations.\n",
    "   - Examples: Fetching a web page, retrieving user details, searching for products.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. POST Method:\n",
    "   - The POST method is used to submit data to be processed by the specified resource.\n",
    "   - It is not idempotent, meaning multiple requests can have different effects on the server, such as creating a new resource or modifying existing data.\n",
    "   - When a client sends a POST request, the data is sent in the body of the request, not visible in the URL.\n",
    "   - The POST method is commonly used when submitting forms, sending user input, or performing actions that modify data on the server.\n",
    "   - It is more secure for sensitive data as compared to the GET method.\n",
    "   - Examples: Submitting a form, creating a new user account, making a purchase, sending data to an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the GET method is used for retrieving data from a server, while the POST method is used for sending data to a server for processing or modification. \n",
    "Both methods serve different purposes and are used in various scenarios based on the type of interaction required between the client and server."
