    "   - It accepts integer-based slicing and indexing, where the start point is inclusive and the end point is exclusive (similar to regular Python indexing).\n",

    "# Q6. What do you understand about the windows function in pandas and list the types of windows\n",

    "In pandas, the window functions are a powerful tool for performing various operations on a rolling or expanding window of data within a DataFrame or Series. These functions allow you to calculate aggregated values, apply transformations, and perform other operations on a subset of data defined by the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "The types of window functions in pandas can be broadly categorized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rolling Window Functions:\n",
    "   - These functions operate on a fixed-size sliding window of data.\n",
    "   - The window \"rolls\" or moves along the data in fixed-size steps.\n",
    "   - Common rolling window functions include mean, sum, min, max, standard deviation, etc.\n",
    "   - Example: `rolling().mean()`, `rolling().sum()`, `rolling().std()`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Expanding Window Functions:\n",
    "   - These functions operate on an expanding window that grows with each data point.\n",
    "   - The window includes all preceding data points.\n",
    "   - Expanding window functions calculate cumulative statistics or aggregated values.\n",
    "   - Common expanding window functions include cumulative sum, cumulative product, etc.\n",
    "   - Example: `expanding().sum()`, `expanding().cumsum()`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Exponentially Weighted Window Functions:\n",
    "   - These functions apply weights to data points in a window, with more recent data receiving higher weights.\n",
    "   - The weights are typically defined exponentially, with decay rates controlling the weight given to older data.\n",
    "   - Exponentially weighted window functions are useful for calculating moving averages with different levels of emphasis on recent data.\n",
    "   - Example: `ewm().mean()`, `ewm().std()`\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the common types of window functions available in pandas. Each type of window function has specific parameters and options to control the window size, behavior, and calculations performed. By using these window functions, you can perform various rolling or expanding window operations on your data, enabling powerful analysis and insights."
