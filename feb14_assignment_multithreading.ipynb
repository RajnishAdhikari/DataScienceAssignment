    "# Q1. what is multithreading in python? hy is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python\n",
    "# Multithreading in Python refers to the process of executing multiple threads simultaneously within \n",
    "# a single process. A thread is a lightweight unit of execution that can run independently, allowing \n",
    "# different parts of a program to run concurrently. Multithreading is used to achieve parallelism and\n",
    "#  improve the performance of a program by utilizing multiple CPUs or CPU cores efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multithreading is used for various purposes, including:\n",
    "# 1. Improving performance: By utilizing multiple threads, tasks can be executed concurrently, \n",
    "# resulting in faster completion of programs. This is particularly beneficial for computationally \n",
    "# intensive or time-consuming operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Handling input/output (I/O) operations: Multithreading is useful for managing I/O-bound tasks, \n",
    "# such as reading from or writing to files, network communication, or interacting with databases.\n",
    "#  While one thread is waiting for I/O operations to complete, other threads can continue executing, \n",
    "# making the program more responsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Parallel processing: Multithreading allows for parallel execution of tasks, enabling \n",
    "# efficient utilization of multiple CPUs or CPU cores. This is especially advantageous for tasks \n",
    "# that can be divided into independent subtasks that can run concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Event-driven programming: Multithreading facilitates event-driven architectures, where different \n",
    "# threads handle different events simultaneously. This is commonly used in graphical user interfaces (GUIs), \n",
    "# web servers, and other applications that need to handle multiple events concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The module used to handle threads in Python is the \"threading\" module. It provides a high-level interface \n",
    "# and tools for creating, managing, and synchronizing threads in Python programs. The threading module \n",
    "# simplifies the process of working with threads by providing functions and classes for starting threads, \n",
    "# managing their lifecycle, and coordinating their execution."

    "#     currentThread()\n",
    "#     enumerate()\n",
    "\n",
    "# The threading module is used in Python for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Simplified thread management: The threading module provides a high-level interface for creating, \n",
    "# managing, and synchronizing threads. It offers functions and classes that abstract away the complexities \n",
    "# of low-level thread operations, making it easier to work with threads in Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Thread creation: The threading module allows the creation of new threads using the Thread class. \n",
    "# This class provides a convenient way to define and start new threads by specifying a target function \n",
    "# or method that will be executed in the new thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Thread synchronization: The threading module provides various synchronization primitives, such as \n",
    "# locks, semaphores, condition variables, and events. These primitives help coordinate the execution \n",
    "# of multiple threads, ensuring that shared resources are accessed safely and preventing race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Thread communication: The threading module includes mechanisms for inter-thread communication, \n",
    "# such as queues and thread-safe data structures. These facilitate the exchange of data and coordination \n",
    "# between threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now, let's discuss the use of the following functions in the threading module:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. activeCount(): This function returns the number of Thread objects currently alive. It helps to \n",
    "# determine the number of active threads in a program. It is useful for monitoring the thread count \n",
    "# or for verifying if any threads are still running before the program terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. currentThread(): This function returns the current Thread object corresponding to the caller's \n",
    "# thread. It provides information about the currently executing thread, such as its name, identification \n",
    "# number (thread ID), and other properties. It is helpful for identifying and distinguishing between \n",
    "# different threads in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. enumerate(): The enumerate() function returns a list of all Thread objects currently alive. It helps \n",
    "# obtain a list of all active threads in a program. It is useful for tasks such as monitoring or inspecting \n",
    "# the status of all running threads, iterating over them for further processing, or performing specific \n",

    "# It allows the thread to begin its activity and run concurrently with other threads in the program.\n",

    "# 3. join(): The join() function is a method defined in the Thread class that blocks the calling thread \n",
    "# until the thread on which it is called completes its execution. When join() is called on a Thread object, \n",
    "# the calling thread waits for the target thread to finish before continuing its own execution. This is \n",

    "# wait for the thread to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. isAlive(): The isAlive() function is a method defined in the Thread class that is used to check if a \n",
    "# thread is currently executing or alive. It returns True if the thread is alive (i.e., it has been started \n",
