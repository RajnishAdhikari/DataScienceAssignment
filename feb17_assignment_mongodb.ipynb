    "# Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "# MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# MongoDB is a popular non-relational (NoSQL) database management system. It is designed to store and \n",
    "# manage large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data. MongoDB uses a flexible and scalable \n",
    "# document model, where data is stored in JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Non-relational databases, including MongoDB, differ from traditional relational databases (SQL databases) \n",
    "# in several ways. In short, non-relational databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Flexible Schema: Non-relational databases allow for dynamic and flexible schemas, meaning each \n",
    "# record/document can have a different structure. This flexibility is beneficial when dealing with \n",
    "# data that doesn't fit well into a rigid, predefined schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Scalability: Non-relational databases are designed to scale horizontally by distributing data \n",
    "# across multiple servers. They can handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Performance: Non-relational databases often provide high-performance data retrieval and storage \n",
    "# capabilities. They are optimized for specific use cases, such as real-time analytics, content management, \n",
    "# and caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Replication and Availability: Non-relational databases typically offer built-in replication and \n",
    "# high availability features. They ensure data durability and availability even in the face of hardware \n",
    "# or network failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. No Joins: Unlike SQL databases, non-relational databases generally do not support complex joins \n",
    "# between multiple tables. Instead, denormalization and embedding techniques are used to improve query \n",
    "# performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Flexible Data Model: When dealing with dynamic and evolving data structures, MongoDB's document \n",
    "# model provides the flexibility to handle changing data requirements without altering the existing schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Large Volumes of Data: MongoDB excels at handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured \n",
    "# data. It can efficiently store and retrieve complex data structures, making it suitable for use cases \n",
    "# like content management systems, IoT data storage, and log analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Scalability and Performance: MongoDB's distributed architecture allows for seamless horizontal scaling, \n",
    "# enabling it to handle high volumes of read and write operations. It provides good performance for real-time \n",
    "# analytics, high-speed transactions, and applications requiring low-latency responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Rapid Development and Iteration: MongoDB's flexible schema and document model make it well-suited for \n",
    "# agile development and rapid iterations. It enables developers to quickly adapt to changing business \n",
    "# requirements without the need for extensive schema migrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# It's important to note that the choice between MongoDB and SQL databases depends on the specific \n",
    "# requirements of your application. SQL databases are still a better fit for applications that heavily \n",
    "# rely on complex joins, transactions, and strict data consistency, while MongoDB shines in scenarios \n",
    "# where scalability, flexibility, and performance are paramount.\n"

    "# Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "# MongoDB is a feature-rich and popular document-oriented NoSQL database management system. \n",
    "# Here are the key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Document-Oriented: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON). \n",
    "# Each document can have its own unique structure, allowing for dynamic schemas and easy representation \n",
    "# of complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Scalability and High Availability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally across multiple servers, \n",
    "# allowing for distributed and efficient data storage. It supports automatic sharding, which enables data \n",
    "# partitioning across multiple nodes to handle large datasets and high traffic loads. MongoDB also provides \n",
    "# built-in replication features to ensure high availability and data durability.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Indexing and Querying: MongoDB supports various indexing techniques, including primary, secondary, \n",
    "# compound, geospatial, and text indexes. These indexes improve query performance by facilitating efficient \n",
    "# data retrieval. MongoDB's flexible query language allows for powerful and expressive queries, supporting \n",
    "# complex filtering, sorting, and aggregation operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. ACID Transactions: Starting from version 4.0, MongoDB introduced multi-document ACID (Atomicity, \n",
    "# Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions. Transactions provide data consistency and integrity \n",
    "# when multiple operations need to be performed atomically, ensuring that all changes are committed \n",
    "# together or rolled back in case of failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Flexible Data Model: MongoDB's schema-less design allows for easy schema evolution and adaptation \n",
    "# to changing data requirements. Developers can add or remove fields from documents without requiring \n",
    "# a predefined schema alteration. This flexibility simplifies application development and reduces the \n",
    "# need for costly and time-consuming migrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Ad Hoc Queries: MongoDB supports ad hoc queries, allowing developers to retrieve and manipulate data \n",
    "# in real-time without the need to predefine complex joins or relationships. This feature makes MongoDB \n",
    "# well-suited for applications where data needs to be queried and processed on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. Rich Query Language: MongoDB's query language includes a comprehensive set of operators and functions, \n",
    "# enabling powerful data manipulation. It supports a wide range of operations such as filtering, sorting, \n",
    "# projection, aggregation, and geospatial queries. This flexibility empowers developers to efficiently \n",
    "# interact with the data and perform complex operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. Flexible Deployment Options: MongoDB can be deployed in various configurations to fit different use \n",
    "# cases. It can run on a single server, as a replica set for high availability, or as a sharded cluster \n",
    "# for horizontal scalability. Additionally, MongoDB Atlas, the official managed database service, offers \n",
    "# cloud-based deployment options with automatic scaling, backups, and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "# These features make MongoDB a popular choice for many applications, including content management systems, \n",
    "# real-time analytics, IoT data management, and mobile applications. Its scalability, flexibility, and rich \n",
    "# query capabilities make it a powerful tool for handling diverse and evolving data requirements.\n"
