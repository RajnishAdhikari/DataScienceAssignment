    "# statement in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Raising Built-in Exceptions:** You can use the `raise` statement to raise built-in \n",
    "# exceptions such as `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `KeyError`, etc. These exceptions already\n",
    "#  have predefined error messages and behavior. For example:\n",
    "\n",

    "        raise ValueError(\"You must be 18 years or older.\")\n",

    "# error message. The exception is then caught in the `except` block, and the error message \n",
    "# is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Raising Custom Exceptions:** You can also use the `raise` statement to raise custom \n",
    "# exceptions that you define by creating your own exception classes. This allows you to \n",
    "# handle exceptional cases specific to your application's requirements. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class FileFormatError(Exception):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "def read_file(file_path):\n",
    "    if not file_path.endswith(\".txt\"):\n",
    "        raise FileFormatError(\"Invalid file format. Only .txt files are supported.\")\n",
    "    # Rest of the file reading logic\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    read_file(\"data.csv\")\n",
    "except FileFormatError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# In this example, the `read_file` function expects a file path and checks if the file format \n",
    "# is valid. If the file does not have a \".txt\" extension, a custom `FileFormatError` exception \n",
    "# is raised with a custom error message. The exception is then caught in the `except` block, \n",
    "# and the error message is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The `raise` statement allows you to generate exceptions programmatically based on specific \n",

    "# built-in `Exception` class or any of its subclasses to provide specialized error handling \n",
    "# for specific situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# We need custom exceptions in Python for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Specific Error Handling:** Custom exceptions allow you to define exceptions that are \n",
    "# specific to your application's domain or functionality. By creating custom exceptions, you \n",

    "# 2. **Code Readability and Maintainability:** Custom exceptions help in improving code \n",

    "# rest of the code, making it easier to understand and maintain.\n",

    "# 3. **Modularity and Reusability:** Custom exceptions promote modularity and reusability. \n",
