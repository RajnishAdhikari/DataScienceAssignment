    "# Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "# A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a manner that allows \n",
    "# for efficient retrieval, management, and manipulation of data. It serves as a central repository for \n",
    "# storing and managing data for various applications or systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL Databases:\n",
    "# SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are based on the relational model. They use structured schemas, \n",
    "# tables, and predefined relationships between tables to store and organize data. Some key characteristics \n",
    "# of SQL databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Data Structure: SQL databases use a tabular structure where data is stored in tables consisting of rows \n",
    "# and columns. Each table has a predefined schema that defines the columns and their data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Schema and Data Integrity: SQL databases enforce a predefined schema, which ensures data integrity and \n",
    "# consistency. The schema specifies the structure, relationships, and constraints of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Query Language: SQL databases use SQL as the standard language for querying and manipulating data. SQL \n",
    "# provides a rich set of operations to perform complex queries, filtering, sorting, aggregations, and joining \n",
    "# of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. ACID Compliance: SQL databases generally adhere to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) \n",
    "# properties, which ensure data consistency and transactional integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "# NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "# NoSQL (Not only SQL) databases are non-relational databases that provide a flexible data model and are \n",
    "# designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Some key characteristics of \n",
    "# NoSQL databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Flexible Data Model: NoSQL databases can handle various data formats, such as key-value pairs, documents, \n",
    "# graphs, or wide-column stores. They allow for dynamic schemas, enabling easy scalability and adaptability to \n",
    "# changing data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Scalability and Performance: NoSQL databases are highly scalable, designed to handle large-scale distributed \n",
    "# systems. They provide high performance for read and write operations, making them suitable for high-traffic \n",
    "# and big data applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. No Joins: Unlike SQL databases, NoSQL databases do not support complex joins between tables. Instead, they \n",
    "# denormalize data to avoid expensive join operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Eventual Consistency: NoSQL databases often prioritize availability and partition tolerance over strict \n",
    "# consistency. They may offer eventual consistency models, where data updates propagate gradually across the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase, and Amazon DynamoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In summary, the main difference between SQL and NoSQL databases lies in their data model, structure, query \n",
    "# language, and consistency guarantees. SQL databases offer structured schemas, SQL querying, and ACID compliance, \n",
    "# while NoSQL databases provide flexibility, scalability, and eventual consistency for handling large volumes of \n",
    "# unstructured or semi-structured data.\n"

    "\n",
    "# 2. DROP:\n",
    "# The DROP statement is used to remove existing database objects, such as tables, indexes, or views. \n",

    "# This statement removes the \"Employees\" table from the database. Caution should be exercised when using \n",

    "# The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. It allows you to add, \n",

    "\n",
    "# Explanation of SELECT:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The SELECT statement is the primary DQL statement used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a \n",

    "# criteria. Only the rows that meet the conditions will be included in the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Additional clauses:\n",

    "# the integrity and uniqueness of the data. Here are some key points about primary keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Uniqueness: A primary key must have unique values for each row in the table. No two rows can have \n",
    "# the same primary key value.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Non-nullability: A primary key column cannot contain NULL values. It ensures that every record in \n",
    "# the table has a valid and unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Single-column or composite key: A primary key can be a single column or a combination of multiple \n",

    "\n",
    "# 4. Indexing: Primary keys are typically indexed by the database system to provide efficient retrieval \n",
